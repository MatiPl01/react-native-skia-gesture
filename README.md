React Native Skia Handler ü§åüèΩ
</h1>

_A detection system for React Native Skia components._

### Motivation

React Native Skia, provides many declarative APIs for building screens using React Components. However, [Skia components are not real components, but abstract representations of a part of a drawing](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia/issues/513#issuecomment-1290126304). Therefore, they do not contain any information about location.
Therefore direct interactions with individual Skia components can only be achieved indirectly from the Canvas (trying to figure out if the point on the screen that was clicked is within the element we want to interact with).

This package, simply provides a set of APIs to be able to interact directly with individual components.

## Installation

**You need to have already installed [@shopify/react-native-skia (>= 0.1.157)](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/getting-started/installation)**

Open a Terminal in your project's folder and install the library using `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-native-skia-handler
```

or with `npm`:

```sh
npm install react-native-skia-handler
```

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  Circle,
  useValue,
} from '@shopify/react-native-skia';

import {
  withTouchableHandler,
  Canvas,
  useGestureHandler,
} from 'react-native-skia-handler';

const TouchableCircle = withTouchableHandler(Circle);

export default function App() {
  const cx = useValue(100);
  const cy = useValue(100);

  const circleGesture = useGestureHandler<{ x: number; y: number }>({
    onStart: (_, context) => {
      context.x = cx.current;
      context.y = cy.current;
    },
    onActive: ({ translationX, translationY }, context) => {
      cx.current = context.x + translationX;
      cy.current = context.y + translationY;
    },
  });

  return (
    <Canvas style={styles.fill}>
      <TouchableCircle cx={cx} cy={cy} r={50} color="red" {...circleGesture} />
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

If the element is a Circle, Rect or RoundedRect, the package will automatically derive its touchablePath. Alternatively it will have to be passed as a parameter to the TouchableComponent.

```jsx
...
const touchablePath = useComputed(() => {
  const path = new Path();
  path.addCircle(cx.current, cy.current, 50);
  return path;
});

return (
  <Canvas style={styles.fill}>
    <TouchableCircle cx={cx} cy={cy} r={50} color="red" touchablePath={touchablePath} {...circleGesture} />
  </Canvas>
);
...
```

## Ingredients

### `Canvas`

It's simply a Wrapper of Skia's Canvas.

---

### `withTouchableHandler`

It's a HOC with which to wrap all Skia components with which you want to interact directly.

---

### `useGestureHandler`

It's a hook from which _onStart_, _onActive_, _onEnd_ interactions can be managed. The hook provides as the second parameter of each callback a context that can be optionally used (strongly inspired by the [useAnimatedGestureHandler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/2.3.x/api/hooks/useAnimatedGestureHandler/) hook).
